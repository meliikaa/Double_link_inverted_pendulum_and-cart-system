# Double_link_inverted_pendulum_and-cart-system
Maintaining the balance of an inverted pendulum riding on a movable carriage that moves in a parallel direction was always considered a classic problem in control systems.
this project was conducted in three phase
**folloing steps were investigated in phase1

1-Obtaining the nonlinear model of the system and introduce its parameters.
2-Linearizeed the obtained model around the appropriate operating point and converted the equations into state space form.Also, specify the valid range of the 3-linear system.
4-Determined Jordan's block diagonal form and also the transformation matrix of this system.
5-Obtaining the transformation function and draw its zero and pole diagram.
6-Checked the internal stability of the system. Is the system asymptotic or boundary stable?
7-Determine the state transition matrix of the system and the state response and output response of the system to an arbitrary initial condition and step input 
8-Obtained the initial conditions in such a way that a certain frequency of the output is not stimulated
9-Kalman decompose the system and subsystems
10-Checked whether the state space is minimal or not. If it is not minimal, specify controllable and observable poles. Is the system stable and detectable?

**Phase2

1-Obtained the irreducible subsystem of your linearized system.
2-Defined a meaningful performance criterion for the desired system.Then, according to defined criterion, got the desired poles. Then, designed the mode 3-feedback controller in such a way that it achieves the defined goals while being stable.
4-Simulate nonlinear and linearized system with the feedback designed in the previous part and analyze the system performance.
5-Defined the appropriate reference signal for tracking system. Designed a static and dynamic precompensator for the linearized system and simulate and analyze the performance of each in the presence of constant disturbance.

**phase3

1- According to system, designed a full-order observer and a reduced-order observer and compare their performance in terms of estimation quality.
