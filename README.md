# Double_link_inverted_pendulum_and-cart-system
Maintaining the balance of an inverted pendulum riding on a movable carriage that moves in a parallel direction was always considered a classic problem in control systems.
this project was conducted in three phase
folloing steps were investigated in phase1
Obtaining the nonlinear model of the system and introduce its parameters.
Linearizeed the obtained model around the appropriate operating point and converted the equations into state space form.Also, specify the valid range of the linear system.
Determined Jordan's block diagonal form and also the transformation matrix of this system.
Obtaining the transformation function and draw its zero and pole diagram.
Checked the internal stability of the system. Is the system asymptotic or boundary stable?
 Determine the state transition matrix of the system and the state response and output response of the system to an arbitrary initial condition and step input 
Obtained the initial conditions in such a way that a certain frequency of the output is not stimulated
Kalman decompose the system and subsystems
Checked whether the state space is minimal or not. If it is not minimal, specify controllable and observable poles. Is the system stable and detectable?
Phase2
Obtained the irreducible subsystem of your linearized system.
Defined a meaningful performance criterion for the desired system.Then, according to defined criterion, got the desired poles. Then, designed the mode feedback controller in such a way that it achieves the defined goals while being stable.
 Simulate nonlinear and linearized system with the feedback designed in the previous part and analyze the system performance.
 Defined the appropriate reference signal for tracking system. Designed a static and dynamic precompensator for the linearized system and simulate and analyze the performance of each in the presence of constant disturbance.
 phase3
 According to system, designed a full-order observer and a reduced-order observer and compare their performance in terms of estimation quality.
